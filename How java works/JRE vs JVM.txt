•	Java source code is the code you write,
•	goes into the JDK and 
•	JDK then compiles it, there is javac compiles it and convert it into bytecode i.e., .class file
•	Byte code runs into JVM
•	JVM converts it into executable code, that we run into JRE and we get the output like Hello World! /Game playing/ app

	JVM & JRE not having compilers only JDK having compiler.

JRE vs JVM
-JRE is the box and JVM is the actual content inside the box
-whatever work JVM is doing, its doing with the help of JRE. Whatever the files and libraries that JVM need JRE will provide it.
